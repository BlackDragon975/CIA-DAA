# CIA-2-DAA

GA -> Genetic Algorithm </br>
CA -> Cultural Algorithm </br>
PSO -> Particle Swarm Optimization </br>
ACO -> Ant Colony Optimization

## Performance Comparison:
### Accuracy:
GA: 91.5% </br>
CA: 90.5% </br>
PSO: 90.4% </br>
ACO: 90.4% </br>

Inference: Pretty much same accuracy for all methods

#### Time To Run:
CA takes much longer than others to run </br>
Other 3 are pretty similar in running time
